About

Uses the love2D low level game engine [https://love2d.org/] (OpenGL, C++, API provided by Lua bindings).
I used this engine to gain experience as I'm currently working on a own 2D game engine offering Lua bindings.

============================================
Features
============================================
- key frame animation using shaders
- particles
- using texture atlases to improve performance (handling more than 2000 small textures)

P                | pause/unpause
